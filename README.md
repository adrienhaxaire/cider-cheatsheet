# cider-cheatsheet
cider instructions in pdf form for easy printing and finding.

Cider is great. it has lots of commands. The README on the github page is great. But when you just want the key commands you have to scroll.. and im really lazy. What I want is a cheatsheet that just has the commands. So I grabbed the readme, removed the things that I didnt want and made a pdf. Now we can all print it on dead trees and read like its 1986.

Happy cidering.
